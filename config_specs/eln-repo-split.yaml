# This config is used to define repository split of the
# ELN Package Set in Content Resolver.
#  - https://tiny.distro.builders/view--view-eln.html
#
#
# This config expects binary RPM names. Not SRPM or component names.
#
# 
# ## Essential information ##
# 
# Runtime packages (explicitly required (listed in workloads) and 
# their runtime dependencies) are divided between baseos, appstream,
# and the addons.
# The default is appstream.
#
# Build dependencies are divided between buildroot-only and crb.
# The default is buildroot-only.
#
#
# ## Deep dive into must vs. want ##
#
# There is a distinction between actually moving a package (must),
# and just flagging a package (want).
#
# Example 1: I want to put bash and all of its runtime dependencies in
# baseos. To do that, I just list 'bash' under baseos / must. 
#
# Example 2: I want to make sure ruby is in appstream. But I don't
# want to move anything around by force. I just want to be notified
# when it's not the case. To do that, I list 'ruby' under
# appstream / want.
#
# Some categories don't have the must list. This is to prevent
# conflicts and unclear behavior. For example, appstream doesn't
# have the must list. That's because:
# a) it's the default
# b) baseos has it, and pulls packages (and their dependencies)
#    out of appstream.
# So anything that can stay in appstream stays there. Anything that
# can't, won't. Forcing a package in appstream even if it can't be there
# would either break things (if it forced the move), or would lead
# to unpredictable results (if it just ignored it).
#
#
# Addons, on the other hand, don't have the want list. That's because
# packages listed under addons are pulled out without their dependencies.
# Addons depend on baseos and appstream. If, however, something requires
# an addon package, the addon package will be duplicated and reported.
#
# Example: Let's say ruby needs kernel-rt. Don't ask me why, this is
# just a silly example to demonstrate things. And kernel-rt is pulled
# out to addon-rt. What happens is that addon-rt will be also duplicated
# into appstream, and reported as it shouldn't be there.
